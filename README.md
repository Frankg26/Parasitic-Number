# Parasitic-Number

This program calculates an n-parasitic number, which is a positive natural number that, when multiplied by n, causes the least significant digit to become the most significant digit.

To use this program, modify the line of code `let test = findNParasiticNumber(2n, 2n);` and replace the integers 2 with appropriate parameters.

The algorithm is based on the one described in the Wikipedia link below:
